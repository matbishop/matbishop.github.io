                <h2>I'm Matthew Bishop.</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Stellenbosch University graduate with a bachelors degree in Mathematical Sciences. I am currently pursuing opportunities for a career in Technology and this page serves as a platform to showcase some of these endeavours.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My love for technology stems from a very young age and has always been a large part of my life. I decided to pursue my passion and have been hard at work to make a fulfilling career in Technology possible. I studied BCom Mathematical Sciences at Stellenbosch University which allowed me to further my love for mathematics. The degree also exposed me to a wide variety of fields such as Computer Science, Mathematical Statistics and Financial Engineering.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I created this website to showcase a selection of my more recent software development projects. I also included some of the reference guides I created with Notion while studying in the hope of assisting others pursuing similar interests. I currently live in Ceres, South Africa and would like to relocate with a preference for roles in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Stellenbosch.
