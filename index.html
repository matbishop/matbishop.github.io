                <h2>I'm Matthew Bishop.</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Stellenbosch University graduate with a bachelor's degree in Mathematical Sciences. I'm currently pursuing opportunities for a career in technology, and this page serves as a platform to showcase some of these endeavours.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My love for technology stems from a young age and has always been a large part of my life. I decided to pursue my passion and have been hard at work to make a fulfilling career possible. I studied BCom Mathematical Sciences at Stellenbosch University, which allowed me to further my love for mathematics. The flexibility of the degree exposed me to a wide variety of fields such as Computer Science, Mathematical Statistics and Financial Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created this website to showcase a selection of my more recent software development projects. It also serves as a location to host the reference guides I created with Notion while studying to make it easier to share my resources with others pursuing similar interests. I currently reside in Ceres, South Africa, intending to relocate to the correct opportunity. I have a preference for roles in Johannesburg and Pretoria.
