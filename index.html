                <h2>I'm Matthew Bishop.</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Full Stack Software Developer and Stellenbosch University graduate with a bachelor's degree in Mathematical Sciences. I'm not currently interested in new opportunities.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My love for technology stems from a young age and has always been a large part of my life. I decided to pursue my passion and have been hard at work to make a fulfilling career possible. I studied BCom Mathematical Sciences at Stellenbosch University, which allowed me to explore advanced mathematical concepts and difficult problems. The flexibility of the degree exposed me to a variety of remarkably interesting fields such as Computer Science, Mathematical Statistics and Financial Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created this website to showcase a selection of my software development projects created while learning. It also served as a location to host the reference guides I created while studying in order to help others pursuing similar interests. I am currently employed as a Full Stack Software Developer in Pretoria, South Africa. I have a passion for my work and look forward to learning something new every day.
